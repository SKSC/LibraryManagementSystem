This project is written by @_SKSC.

This is a library management system which is written in Delphi with MySQL. In this system, all required information is stored separately in MySQL.
Different user groups are granted different permissions. This is the system that can meet all need for diminutive library use.

However, this is just a demo that can only run on local machine. If you want to implement this project in real life, you have to write some your own functions to support network access.
